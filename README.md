# Bump Version

A little tool which may help to bump version for your projects files.

## Installation

Assuming that you cloned emacs-bump-version to the
`~/.emacs.d/bump-version/` folder. Add the following lines to your
`.emacs` file:

```
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/bump-version/")
(require 'bump-version)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-b p") 'bump-version-patch)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-b i") 'bump-version-minor)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-b m") 'bump-version-major)

```

## Configuration

You can create config file for your project by means of `bump-version-create-config`
command. It just creates `.bump-version.el` file in the default-directory (it means
you must be in your project root). `bump-version-create-config` command creates and
opens `.bump-version.el` file. Just edit it (add file names in which version needs to
be updated) and save.

Or you can create it manually. Add `.bump-version.el` file to your project root
directory. For example, for `bump-version` project it looks like the following:

```
((:files
  ("Cask"
   "bump-version.el"
   "bump-version-pkg.el"))
 (:current-version "0.2.1"))
```

Then you can interactively call `bump-version-patch`,
`bump-version-minor` or `bump-version-major` commands and a version
will be updated for the specified files (also for the
`.bump-version.el` file).
